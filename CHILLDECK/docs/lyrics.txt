a heartbeat starts out
like a drum set to a timer
that always seems to end too soon

and we are all connected
like tides around the world
being pushed and pulled by an
unseen force that stretches out to the moon

promises come between us
and words get in the way
but ambitions
they see light by those who do

of the life we knew
we live, we love, we fall

what was that feeling I knew
inner peace... inner peace

freedom is never free
one cannot not measure, weigh
or tally up it's cost

when you can feel
get up
to discover the new 
to take the step

and if there is no tomorrow
then there never was a today
